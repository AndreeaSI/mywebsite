        Visual Studio Code was the main tool I used to build my website. I found it convenient to work with, since I used VS Code prior to this project. I didn’t have the chance to work with other code editors than VS Code, so I cannot compare it, but I’m happy with how this tool supported my code writing.
Trello was my first and only Kanban planning tool I used so far. It showed to be very useful with the planning and keeping track of all the text content of my website. The fact it can be accessed by the tutor in real time and all the updates I make are visible to them, it seems to be very practical and helps me to get feedback on my work straight away, without having to send over any work I done at that given time.

<div class="tab__content">
    I consider VS Code had the right fit for the task since I was able to work with different languages. 
Adding tools like Trello (which keeps the track of all the writing content), Slack (one of the main platforms we used for communicating, sharing files and code to be tested) and Zoom (main platform for presentations) helped making a very appropriate selection for the scale and size of our projects.
We’ve been offered some extra tools such fonds.google.com which has a big fond variety to suit our websites and also coolors.co for its color pallets. Both tools were useful and appropriate for the website project.

    <div class="tab__content">
        The website project was an interesting challenge, I’ve learned a lot in a very short period of time. I enjoyed very much the experience as a whole and of course I wish I would have done it better.
The time limit of the project it seemed to be most challenging. I consider I could have done a better job if I would have a bit more time to spend on coding. I big chunk of the given time was spent on writing the content of the website, but doing all the research needed for writing that content was very informative and now I feel like I have a better understanding of technology and its importance.
If I could change anything I would probably try to be more organized and finish writing the content first and than focus on coding. When it comes to the actual website, if I have had more time, I would play more with CSS by connecting all the elements and I would make them to stand out.


</div>
    <div class="tab__content">
Further improvements:

I would choose to build a website where the layout is kept simple and easy to be navigated;

I would look for ways to guide the viewer more accurately;

I would try to make my website mobile compatible and more user-friendly all around.

</div>
    <div class="tab__content">
        Building your first website can be exciting, but equally overwhelming, especially when there is a time limit to complete it. So preparing ahead seems to be a good start. If your website aims to inform, maybe focus on doing enough research so the offered information is accurate and up to date. When you have the content, try to link the subject to the layout and the design you want to go for and establish your website’s tone, based on your target audience (e.g.: formal and informative or personal and descriptive etc). 
        Having a navigation bar with clear and familiar options is important; this way you point the viewer in the right direction. If you go for a mobile friendly layout, you create a nice experience to your viewer and boost the website traffic.

        Using a Trello board has benefited my project to get the organizing content aspect out of the picture, since it has this easy to follow assembling features. It was even more useful with making a Python game, where I had to work as part of a team, so Trello had a huge role with monitoring urgent tasks and helped with having a clear view of every member’s contribution to the final result.
        Tools like Zoom and Slack make the communicating part very easy and they were very relevant when dealing with team projects.
        
        A team project that involves building a first website sounds very challenging to me, particularly when the team members do not know each other and they are in the middle of taking in all the new information from the course, so there is no experience at all in building website nor in being part of a team you’ve never spoken to.

        With this course I assured myself which “sectors” of my diligence I need to improve/moderate. 
        Being conscientious did not work always in my favor, so I should probably try to break more often from work and give my mind a refresh by trying to engage in other activities, such as meditation or by emptying my head for a minute and try not to think in every tiny detail how to complete my tasks. This way, I would probably accomplished more and have better results.
        
    </div>

    <div class="tab__content">
        The team project experience taught me how to bring ideas/ solutions/ issues into conversation, it taught the importance of listening to someone’s point of view and act accordantly (in case your team member delivers a better idea/ solution) or to stick to yours when you think it’s necessary ( and find support between your team members).

I will apply this new take on what being part of team implies to my future team projects and that will surly improve my both my own and team’s productivity.
