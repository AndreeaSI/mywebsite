        “Although the range of potential barriers to persons with disabilities in the online environment is extensive, there are ways to develop and implement technologies so that persons with disabilities are included.

        Despite all of these barriers, the Internet has been justifiably viewed as having enormous potential for promoting social inclusion for persons with disabilities. Currently, some Internet technologies are a significant benefit to people with specific types of disabilities.
        
        What does it mean to have an accessible interface? In the technology world, it means that your computer interface will work for people with disabilities, many of whom use an assistive technology to access software, operating systems, and Web sites. Commonly used assistive technologies include a screen reader, which provides computer-synthesized speech output of what appears on the screen; speech recognition, which allows for hands-free input; and various alternative keyboards and pointing devices.
         
        Most Web accessibility regulations around the world are based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, a set of standards from the World Wide Web Consortium.
        
        Yet the technical solutions are easy. They don’t involve any type of advanced coding. They generally involve adding appropriate markup, such as using good descriptive text to describe graphics, table columns, forms, and links. These solutions are the responsibility of Web site developers, designers, and Webmasters. No additional technical expertise is needed, just an awareness of the need to provide appropriate labels.”

The most appropriate file types for building basic websites are also the ones I opted for when creating my first webpage. These are:
<br>HTML: The Language of the Web
<br>HTML is the single most important standard in web design—and the only one that’s absolutely required if you plan to create a web page. Every web page is written in HTML.
<br>CSS
<br>CSS is a highly effective HTML tool that provides easy control over layout and presentation of website pages by separating content from design.
<br>JPG/ JPEG
<br>JPG and JPEG are interchangeable. They both have the same meaning. The different file extensions are due to the earlier versions of Windows.
<br>JPG is one of the most popular image file format and compress an image, significantly reducing the size of the file.

For the homepage of my website I chose to have a text logo called genre: rawAesthete. The logo’s name reflects my take on the possible use of technology, which can be recognized also in the images I used. The headline supports and makes clear the idea of using technology for a more sustainable future.
I kept the navigation bar quite simple and I added 4 links to 4 different pages.
All web pages I created make use of the same layout, a drop text bar which reveals the content of each subject when clicked on. In this way, the pages do not look crowded with too much text.
For “About me” webpage I opted for a simple description, but different font styles and different background image/ colour palette.
