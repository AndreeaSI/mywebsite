    <p>Hi there! I’m Andreea and I started my tech journey about 9 months ago. 
        The idea of getting into IT was like a lightning strike to me and it made so much sense so I start learning a programming language. My first (and favourite!) language I dived in was Java Script. Managing to write my first blocks of code on my own, by simply watching a tutorial on udemy.com, was so rewarding to me. After a long time, I finally felt creative and on the right track I would say, since my day job as retail cashier did not give me anything but emptiness.
          
        <br>Technology incorporates so many things we surround ourselves with every day of this modern world, is truly improving our lives so I find this a fascinating time to join this field.
        
        I do have some soft spots for other things than learning programming languages, one of them would be aesthetic design or what I call signature style (a way you choose to express yourself through everything you surround yourself with from fabrics to home design). It’s a territory where I seek for balance where style never overcomes environmental awareness. I work towards a more sustainable future (on a very small scale, I’m aware) and by making smarter choices I am limiting my personal waste, and thanks to many very talented artists how also embraced this movement, I do not have to compromise my sense of styling in any way.
        
        <br>Technology can take a huge part in a sustainable development process that benefits both us and future generations who also deserve a close to nature living, so my goal is to build upon my software programming knowledge and implement it in projects that sustain an ecologically friendly environment.
