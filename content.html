         In this current day and age, IT plays a massive role.
        With the introduction of computers, the business world was changed indefinitely. Using computers and software, modern businesses use IT to secure that their departments run without any problems. IT has allowed businesses to match the supply with the demand of consumers that wish to have their needed products here and now.
        Information technology benefits the business world by allowing companies to run more efficiently and to maximize productivity. In business, people look for ways to do more work in a shorter amount of time and it should be only possible through the development of IT. Faster communication, electronic storage and the protection of records are advantages that IT can have on a successful business.

        We live in a digital age. Our digital world is filled with millions of talented people working on a diverse set of projects that power our online and offline lives.
The people who design what we access on our screens are masters at planning, communicating, collaborating, and ultimately creating. These are the people who make up digital project management.
Digital project management is a young practice in modern businesses. Digital project management is about getting things done in a digital world. The thing is, Digital PM has a simple goal, but can employ multiple complex tools to get the job done and requires strategy and diversified skill sets. A key skill of a Digital Project Manager is the ability to be a scrum master who knows how to be a gatekeeper and not just a facilitator. Some other paramount traits a Digital PM needs to have are the ability to provide clear direction, to delegate tasks, to manage up and “to budgetize”.
Choosing the right methodology is important because it defines how we decide to work. It provides the structures that can guide us toward project success or failure. And since we already know there is no one-size-fits-all method that works for all business types it’s important that you put some time and effort into choosing the right project management methodology for our context. Two of the most popular methodologies used by digital agencies are Agile and Waterfall.
As a set of principles, Agile tends to be used as an umbrella term for flavours of Agile including Scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), Kanban, and Scrumban.
Waterfall methodology, often referred to as SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a project management methodology theme with a very simple approach that values solid planning, doing it once and doing it right.

        genre:rawAesthete is my first website I created. Because of that I plan to keep it simple and not overdo it, since I have a timeframe to finish it. I would like to try bringing a current issue into attention, something personal I believe in so it’s more interesting and engaging when access it. 
I use Trello to plan each step of building the website and that helps with having a clear view of the project as a whole. You can find my Trello board here: https://trello.com/b/egYRdF5O/my-website

A possible risk that impacts a digital project could be changing the project objectives. These are to blame for a significant percentage for projects to go west, but changes in the plan don’t have to lead to failure.
Digital projects are immanently a high-risk proposition. A lot fail. It’s natural. Part of this is just the nature of novelty — you have to make a lot of nonsense to get something good. And as technology becomes more closely associated with every aspect of a business, digital projects compel more planning, more cooperation, and more buy-in than ever before. Beyond cooperation, there are a few specific risks worth looking out for when it comes to digital projects: 
<br>•	Ignoring business processes
<br>•	Failing to complete executive buy-in
<br>•	Spending budget on cool and shiny gadgets instead of solving business objectives or better customer experiences
<br>•	Poor project definition / expectation setting
<br>•	Bad vendor selection

    Depending on the objectives of the project, its size and complexity I would choose to do the programming in a high level language (HLL). Is known that you can do pretty much anything when using languages such as Python, PHP, ECMA Script, Ruby, C#, Java etc. and you are limited only by time and budget.
Web projects development:
<br>For simple sites, out-of-the-box solutions are often best suited, ex: CMS (Content Management System: WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, Magento)
<br>Complex projects are made on frameworks (React.js, Angular.js) or written in HLL programming languages.
<br>Mobile applications:

<br>For simple and advanced mobile apps for tests can be cross-platform (C++)

<br>For complex mobile apps, market-targeted applications must be native. Native app development for iOS is performed mainly in a programming language Swift, previously Objective-C was used in this case. And Java, as well as Kotlin, are popular for Android native apps.

    Visual Studio Code has helped me with code writing and due to its functionality (VS Code offers support for many languages) I was able to shift from Java script to Python, from HTML to CSS, using the same code editor the whole time, VS Code.

    <br>Trello came in handy for a game project management where I worked as part of a team.  Its visual Kanban cards are flexible, shareable and let you pack loads of details into each card.
     
    <br>When we had allocated a team project, Slack played a big part of sharing our work. The possibility of communicating with my team on a private channel helped both us and other teams to be more productive and focused on our projects with no external distractions

    GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) represents a new piece of EU legislation regulating the processing of personal data that, starting on May 25, 2018, will replace the current EU directive regulating that area, adopted in 1995.
 “GDPR regulates how companies store data. For example, from now on, every digital business has to design data flows in its services having in mind the principle of data minimization, meaning that the scope of collected data, the purposes of their processing, and their retention all have to be reduced to the absolute minimum. So, no more collecting and storing data “because we might need in the future,” which was and still continues to b a very common approach to data retention, examples of which include the widespread practice of collecting email contacts for marketing, sales purposes or even designing user account registration forms” says Monterail’s in-house lawyer, Kamila Koszewicz
